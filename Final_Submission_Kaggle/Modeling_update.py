"""
Purpose: The purpose of the following code is to predict the labels for the given test set (public and private) via the use of an ensemble model. The ensemble at the very end averages the predictions of a random forest model 
and an XGBoost model. The script also includes some data cleaning and feature engineering steps to ensure that the test data and training data are in the same format. With cleaned data sets, the model training process 
is conducted. The hyperparmeters of the models are tuned via the use of grid search and cross-validation. The final predictions are saved to a csv file.

Functions: ensemble_rf_xbg: This function's parameters are the training data, test data, categorical columns, and the output directory. The function returns a dataframe that contains the predictions for the test data.

Inputs: 
    - training_data: This is the training data that will be used for training the models. The training data should be the file path to the training data csv file produced via the Train_Set_Engineering.py script.
    - test_data: This is the test data that will be used for making predictions. The test data should be the file path to the test data csv file produced via the Test_Set_Engineering.py script.
    - categorical_columns: This is a list of the categorical columns that will be used for one-hot encoding. The default value is None. In general, this parameter should NOT be changed. 
    - output_directory: This is the file path to the csv file that will contain the predictions for the test data. You MUST set the location of the output directory if wanting to save the predictions to a csv file.

Outputs: 
    - prediction_df: This is a dataframe that contains the predictions for the test data. The dataframe has two columns, which is the ID and Predicted columns. The ID column has the account.id values for the test data.
